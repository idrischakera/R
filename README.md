R codes and snippets
 
This repository contains various tools and code snippets for day to day usage in the realms of Data Science using R.
I try to document each of them, especially the ones which don't have a proper description of usage on the Internet.
Hope this helps someone like me, trying to figure out the nuances of the Art of Data Science.
Also, suggestions are more than welcome, at chakeraidris@gmail.com or www.linkedin.com/in/idrischakera , or maybe you can just drop a Hi :)

Cheers!
