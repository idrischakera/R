animals<- c("cat","moose","impala","ant","kiwi")

grepl(pattern= "a",x=animals) #returns TRUE for all elements that contain "a"

grepl(pattern= "^a",x=animals) #returns TRUE for all elements that start with "a"

grepl(pattern= "a$",x=animals) #returns TRUE for all elements tha end with "a"

Here, what we are giving to the pattern argument is a regular exxpression (regex)
?regex

# which() returns the indexes where it finds TRUE in the vector
which(grepl(pattern= "a",x=animals) 

# grep() function works same as which(grepl())
grep(pattern= "a",x=animals)
